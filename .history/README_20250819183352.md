### Set up the database

📖 **See detailed instructions in [`supabase/README.md`](./supabase/README.md)**

**Quick Setup:**
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)
2. Start local development: `supabase start`
3. For remote deployment: `supabase login && supabase link && supabase db push`

The database includes:
- ✅ **8 forum tables** with full schema
- ✅ **Sample data** (categories, posts, comments, tags)
- ✅ **Row Level Security** policies
- ✅ **Guest posting** support
- ✅ **Automatic triggers** for vote counting and user stats

ℹ️ _Note: This forum uses the Supabase extension for Netlify. Environment variables `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured automatically via the Netlify Supabase extension._

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
