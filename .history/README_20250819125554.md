## Deploying to Netlify

If you click "Deploy to Netlify" button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify.

### Set up the database

To use this template, you’ll need to set up and seed a new Supabase database.

1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Run the SQL commands found in the `supabase/migrations` directory in the Supabase UI.
3. To seed the database with data, you can import the contents of the `supabase/seed.csv` file in the Supabase UI.

ℹ️ _Note: This template was created to be used with the Supabase extension for Netlify. If you don’t wish to use the Netlify Supabase extension, you will need to set the `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file._

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
